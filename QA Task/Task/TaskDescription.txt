Basic description: 
We have a backend program (backend.jar) which takes file as an input from the drop zone folder and processes it.
The result of the backend program is the CSV file saved in the location specified through arguments.
CSV file contains a key/value pairs that are used to create a chart in a web page.
To run backend.jar: java -jar backend.jar "path/To/Input.txt" "path/To/UI/server/CSVs/dir"

We also have a UI server that takes results file and visualizes it as a bar chart.
To run nodejs server use this command in dir containing server js: "node server.js"

Goals:
1. Verify that the whole system (backend, UI) can be started and run.

2. Verify data flow.
You need to create automated test to ensure both (baclend and UI) programs work and the end result (a chart) can be generated and displayed.

3. Verify data integrity.
Check at least a couple of data points in the chart to be sure results are correct. For example, make sure that with a given input file the char 'r' has a value of 16.

Have above mentioned verifications run in automated manner.
You can choose how to report test results - a text file is ok.
What we require to be reported?
1. Overall state of the system - red or green
2. Details of what failed IF failed
